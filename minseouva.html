                <p>To better support international students' academic careers at UVA, I took the initiative to host an event where I presented the Honor System and how it could be an accessible resource. The group discussions and addressing students' concerns were a great opportunity to foster an open conversation about academic integrity and support mechanisms available to international students.</p>
