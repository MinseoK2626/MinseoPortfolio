            Starting as an educator of the Honor Committee, I have led the Honor Educator pool as a Senior Educator for the year 2024-2025. I have collaborated with Honor representatives at UVA to better promote the Honor System and have put in efforts to support students.

        <p>
            To better support international students' academic careers at UVA, I took the initiative to host an event where I presented the Honor System and how it could be an accessible resource. The group discussions and addressing students' concerns were a great opportunity to foster an open conversation about academic integrity and support mechanisms available to international students.
