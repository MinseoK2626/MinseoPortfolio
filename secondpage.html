            <div class="case-title">Interesting ECM Case: Uber's IPO (2019)</div>
            <p>In contrast to high expectations, Uber's stock price fell by 7.6%, closing at $41.57 from the initial offering price of $45.</p>
            <p>Despite its data-based operation, utilization of the platform economy, and on-demand service, which are appealing factors, there were controversies regarding Uber's business model and its sustainability.</p>
            <p class="takeaway">Takeaway: There is no definite equation in business. Due to rapidly emerging trends, it is important to stay on these trends and incorporate a variety of factors while considering and making decisions.</p>

            <div class="case-title">Interesting M&A Case: Tapestry's Failed Acquisition of Capri</div>
            <p>Recently, Tapestry, which owns popular brands like Coach and Kate Spade that appeal to a broad demographic, experienced a surge in its stock price. However, after the acquisition of Capri was blocked by federal authorities, Capri's stock saw a significant drop.</p>
            <p><strong>Why Did the Deal Fall Through?</strong><br>
            The deal was blocked by federal court due to legal concerns about monopolistic practices in the fashion industry. This case highlights the need for companies to be cautious about regulatory scrutiny when considering M&A or joint ventures. It underscores the importance of assessing the potential external controls or impacts these transactions may face.</p>
            <p><strong>Implications</strong><br>
            Those holding put options may see increased profits, whereas investors with call options would face losses under these circumstances.</p>
            <p><strong>My Thoughts</strong><br>
            I believe the sectors most likely to face increased regulatory and legal challenges in the future are technology and AI. Even groundbreaking technologies or innovative programs may be blocked from launching, which can significantly impact business outcomes. Therefore, it’s crucial to realistically assess whether a strong potential investment can genuinely translate into profit before making decisions or investments.</p>

            <div class="case-title">Recent Trends in Acqui-Hire</div>
            <p>Acqui-hire refers to the traditional M&A strategy in which technology enterprises acquire startups not only for their innovative technology but also for their founders and key talent.</p>
            <p>However, the SEC’s recent stringent regulations on M&A activities involving big tech firms have made such acquisitions increasingly difficult. Main examples include Adobe’s Figma acquisition failure and Google’s failed attempt to acquire Wiz.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Emerging Acqui-Hire Trend: Direct Talent Hiring</strong><br>
            In response to these regulatory hurdles, big tech companies are pivoting to directly hiring key talent without acquiring the startups themselves. Key examples include Google hiring the founders of Character.AI as employees and Microsoft directly hiring the founders and team of Inflection AI.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Impact</strong><br>
            While startup founders and key talent are successfully integrated into big tech firms, this strategy often results in disappointing payouts for startup investors compared to traditional acquisitions.</p>
            
            <p class="takeaway"><strong>Takeaway:</strong> The rapid growth of AI and technology has driven innovation at an unprecedented pace, but it has also triggered tightened SEC regulations on traditional M&A activities. As a result, big tech companies are redefining their acquisition strategies, focusing on direct talent hiring to sidestep regulatory scrutiny. For stock performance, big tech firms adopting this strategy may avoid the regulatory bottlenecks of traditional M&A, potentially providing more predictable growth opportunities in the market. However, the long-term impact on their innovation pipelines remains uncertain.</p>
