        <h1>Hi! I'm Minseo</h1>
        <p> I am a second-year student at the University of Virginia, studying computer science and finance at McIntire School of Commerce. I have a strong interest in finance, technology, and culture.</p>

        <h2>Minseo at VISAS</h2>
        <img src="../images/visasmerged.jpg" alt="VISAS Activity" class="centered-img">
        <p>
            As an international student, I have a deep passion for embracing cultural diversities and helping our international community. As an ESL Assistant Program Coordinator, I recruit and train volunteers and foster a better class environment!
        </p>

        <h3>My Motivation</h3>
        <p>What truly motivates me in my role is the support and encouragement I receive from our volunteers. Their kind words remind me why this work is so meaningful:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><em>"Minseo has been wonderful and very welcoming, especially as someone who hasnâ€™t been an ESLA before. She really had passion for her position and strives to be helpful to all of us! I really appreciate the articles she sends each week to give us some ideas about how to engage the international students before our volunteering starts."</em></li>

            <li><em>"Minseo has been amazing! She is so kind and helpful and I feel she's fulfilled her role as a mentor for us volunteers splendidly!"</em></li>

            <li><em>"My ESLA intern's communication with us volunteers is phenomenal! I am always grateful for the session reminders sent out through Group-me... I find the resources Minseo sends to be quite valuable... It is quite helpful in identifying areas where I can improve my communication and/or any successful techniques that I should continue to use."</em></li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Receiving these kinds of comments has been incredibly meaningful. They remind me that leadership is rooted in empathy, and they inspire me to continue creating a welcoming, inclusive space where every student and volunteer feels seen, supported, and empowered.

        <p>
            Starting as an educator of the Honor Committee, I have led the Honor Educator pool as a Senior Educator for the year 2024-2025. I have collaborated with Honor representatives at UVA to better promote the Honor System and have put in efforts to support students.

        <h3>International Students Day</h3>
        <img src="../images/honorisd.jpg" alt="Honor International Students Day" class="centered-img">
        <p>
            To better support international students' academic careers at UVA, I took the initiative to host an event where I presented the Honor System and how it could be an accessible resource. The group discussions and addressing students' concerns were a great opportunity to foster an open conversation about academic integrity and support mechanisms available to international students.
